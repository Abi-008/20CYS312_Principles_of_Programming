## Assignment - 01: Exploring Programming Paradigms in Common Programming Languages

### Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of programming paradigms, reinforce your knowledge of previously studied programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript), and prepare you for the upcoming Principles of Programming Language course.

#### Assignment Components:

- Introduction and Paradigm Selection:
  - Two programming paradigms for exploring.

- Research:
  - Investigate how the selected paradigms are implemented.
  - Explore key language features that align with each paradigm.

- Comparative Analysis and Case Studies:
  - Compare how the selected paradigms are expressed in the common languages.
  - Identify and analyze real-world projects or applications that use these paradigms in the specified languages.

- Presentation Preparation:
  - Concise presentations.
  - Inclusion of code snippets and examples from the common languages.

- Presentations:
  - 10-15 minutes per presentation.
  - Questions and brief discussions after each presentation.

- Reflection and Report:
  - Submit a short report summarizing their key findings (2-3 pages).

#### Submission:

- Presentations can be conducted in-person.
- Reports should be submitted electronically.

#### Grading Criteria:

- Quality and depth of research into paradigms in common languages.
- Clarity and effectiveness of the presentation.
- Thoughtfulness in comparative analysis.
- Relevance and insightfulness of case studies.
- Critical reflection in the report.
